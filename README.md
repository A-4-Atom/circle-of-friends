# CIRCLE Social Integration Service

This is a small React app designed to help you find a new circle of friends. It is all done tongue-in-cheek and only for entertainment purposes. The app relies on two free APIs: [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) and [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/).

As an exercise in open source collaboration, a few issues have been opened. Feel free to contribute! Contact the project owner via said issues.
